# Clustering Penguin Species Project

This project explores clustering techniques to identify and group different penguin species from the Palmer Archipelago dataset. Using unsupervised machine learning, it analyzes key features such as bill length, flipper size, and body mass to reveal natural groupings among the species. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and clustering algorithms like K-Means. Results provide insights into species differentiation and the effectiveness of clustering methods on real-world ecological data.
